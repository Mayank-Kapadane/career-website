# Let's see you have done some work on replit now you want to save it on github so, how can we do.

- goto github repo
  - It doesn't have those changes we made on replit

- so, as we do some devlopment locally and then we push to github same way here, We have git (version control tab) in tools section of Explorer

- stage the files and commit

- go back to github and reload the page
